# AoC-2019
[Advent of Code](adventofcode.com) Solutions for 2019. This is my first year doing Advent of Code, used it as an opportunity to learn Go(lang)

## Highlights

Favourite problems:

* None yet

Interesting approaches:

* None yet

Leaderboard Appearances:

* Not likely given that I'm only just learning Go, but you never know...

## From [Ullaakut](https://github.com/Ullaakut/aoc19)
* Automatically downloads the challenge and input for the day (e.g.: make download DAY=03)
  * In order to use this target, you need to specify your session cookie from adventofcode.com in AOC_COOKIE.
  * Parses the challenge into a markdown file (adds Markdown style headers and code blocks).
  * This part still needs a bit of work, as multiline code blocks are not supported yet, and formatting (bold, italics etc.) is lost.
